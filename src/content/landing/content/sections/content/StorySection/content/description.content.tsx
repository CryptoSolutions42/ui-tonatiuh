      Hinkal Protocol was inspired by the delicious khinkali dumplings of Georgia. Just like the diverse range of
      ingredients that make up a delicious khinkali, Hinkal Protocol offers a privacy layer, where the ingredients are
      transactions and assets that can be shielded from public visibility to create a unique and personalized financial
      experience.

      With Hinkal Protocol, no one knows how much assets users have or which transactions they made, ensuring their
      privacy and security. But Hinkal Protocol isn't just about privacy and security - it's also about convenience and
      ease of use. Our platform is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing even those without technical
      expertise to easily navigate and use Hinkal, similar to how anyone can enjoy the wonderful taste of khinkali
      without knowing its ingredients."
